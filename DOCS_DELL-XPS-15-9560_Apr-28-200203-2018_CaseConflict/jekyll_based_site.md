# How does jekyll work

#### Create layouts (templates for django people) to generate your views
#### Create content files with yml variables(date) and html / plain text to feed into the layouts
#### Use scss (sass) or less to style (automatically preprocessed into css during build) - see _sass (partials)
#### Main content goes into _pages
#### Use Liquid templating language (similar to jinja2 / django templating languages) to create logic
#### includes are your friends - use them as modules, functions , snippets of html or whatever
#### time related files - _posts (see chapters_events), categories are automatically generated by jekyll using the parent folder name as the category name
#### subject related files - collections, have to add them in _config.yml for jekyll to see them properly (see _sponsors, _chapters)
#### Config in _config.yml
#### Static content - images, javascript, css in static folder.

#### When change pushed to master / origin - github pages rebuilds the site.
