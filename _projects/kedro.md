Kedro is an open source development workflow tool that helps structure reproducible, scaleable, deployable, robust and versioned data pipelines. It is applicable to a wide range of projects, from single user projects running on a local environment, when you want to have an organised way of working, to enterprise-level team projects, when your team needs to work in a structured way and reduce the effort required to take machine learning models into the production environment.
