This time we will be working in [python-dateutil](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil), one of the most downloaded libraries from PyPI and the de-facto extension for date and times manipulation in Python.

We will have the maintainer of python-dateutil - [Paul Ganssle](https://github.com/pganssle)- helping and reviewing code during the sprint. He will guide us through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues) and organise the work to be carried out along the day.
