In this sprint we will be focussing on improving the documentation of different python projects.
Everybody is welcome to propose projects. At the beginning of the sprint, people willing to lead
a group will have the opportunity to briefly explain which issues they would like to work on. And
the rest of the people will be able to join any group they want.

Some of the projects that will be proposed:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

For this sprint, we will be honoured by the visit of **Eric Holscher**. Eric is a director at the
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). Eric is also co-founder of
[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) the de-facto platform for publishing Python projects
documentation (used by lots of projects including `jupyter`, `requests`, `pillow` to name few).
Eric is also co-founder of [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/), a global
community of people who cares about documentation.
