**IMPORTANT UPDATE: About #COVID19**

As the situation evolved and we have the safety of the participants in mind, this sprint will be FULL REMOTE.

Just join the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/882305838) for participation and [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JJM5S2x) for chat and collaboration.

------------------

We won't let the virus stop us from contribute to open-source (actually what is better than contributing when you are stying at home)?

We have 2 projects at this sprint:

--------------------

### TerminusDB - documentation

The first one is help writing docstrings for the Python client library of TerminusDB. The library consist of an API (which uses requests a lot), a query language (yup, query language in Python) and tools to work with pandas DataFrame.

They use the same format of docstrings as numpy and pandas so it will be a good practice for writing docstrings without the stress of contributing to a huge project. (I can assure you your PR will be reviewed quickly).

List of methods that need documentation is listed [here](https://github.com/terminusdb/documentation-sprint).

You can also have a look at their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-client-python) and [issues](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminus-client-python/issues).

--------------------

### DRF API Tracking

DRF API Tracking provides a Django model and DRF view mixin that work together to log Django Rest Framework requests to the database. You'll get these attributes for every request/response cycle to a view that uses the mixin.

Have a look at their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lingster/drf-api-tracking) and [issues](https://github.com/lingster/drf-api-tracking/issues).

--------------------

You can choose either one project to work on (or both if you know what you are doing :-P)

For beginners in open-source, we will have a beginners table for making your first pull request on GitHub.

As usual, we will give priority to join the sprint to the people who:

- Experienced open source contributors
- People from underrepresented minorities in our sprints

There is **no limit** on remote participation.
