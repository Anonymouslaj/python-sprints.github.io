The London Python sprints group started well over a year ago, and since then we organised more than 20 sprints. Contributing to projects such as pandas, dateutil, Tornado, or the python.org website. This time we will go back to one of our all time favourites and work on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). We would also like to thank [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/) for sponsoring this event, they are joining us as a sponsor for the first time and we are looking forward to working with them.

At the beginning of February [Marc](https://twitter.com/datapythonista) organised the [Europandas Summit](https://python-sprints.github.io/europandas2019/). Following from this, there are many great ideas and loads of work to be done on the Pandas package and this sprint will be aimed at addressing some of these. Additionally, our sponsor this time will give a short talk about Data Science at Deliveroo.

No matter if this is your first sprint or if you are a seasoned sprinter with us, everyone is welcome. For this sprint only, if you have attended the Europandas Summit either as a first timer or long term contributer, we will initially save a few spots for you. Please message Florian directly via the meetup page.

Remember to:

- Bring your own charged laptop
