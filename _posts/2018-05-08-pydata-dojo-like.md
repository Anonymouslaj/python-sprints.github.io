**Note that this sprint starts at 6pm (and not at 6:30pm, as mmost events in the past).**

In this sprint we will try a new and cooler format, and we will sprint in a Dojo like way.

A Dojo is an event were Pythonistas improve their skills by performing a kata. A kata is a
programming task oriented to get some practice in specific programming patterns.

While we will still work in making open source software better, we will borrow the
format of our [London Python Dojo](https://twitter.com/ldnpydojo) friend, which is
described in the agenda.

**Agenda**

- 6pm: Doors open, pizza and beer served, and **sprint proposals**
- 6:30pm: Sprint proposals voting, and group creation
- 7pm-9pm: Coding in groups
- 9pm: Group presentations

Bring your OWN ideas to make your sprint proposal:

- That annoying bug you wanted to see fixed
- That missing feature you need
- That documentation page needs some care
- ...

To narrow the scope of the sprint, all ideas should be for data related projects
(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, pytorch, your own data project...).
