**Note that this sprint starts at 6pm (and not at 6:30pm, as most events in the past).**

In this sprint we will try a new and cooler format, and we will sprint in a Dojo like way.

A Dojo is an event were Pythonistas improve their skills by performing a kata. A kata is a
programming task oriented to get some practice in specific programming patterns.

While we will still work in making open source software better, we will borrow the
format of our [London Python Dojo](https://twitter.com/ldnpydojo) friends, which is
described in the agenda.

**Agenda**

- 6pm: Doors open, pizza and beer served, and **proposal of sprint topics**
- 6:30pm: Voting of the sprint topics, and group creation
- 7pm-9pm: Coding in groups
- 9pm: Group presentations

To narrow the scope of the sprint, all ideas should be for data related projects
(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, pytorch, your own data project...). Do not try
to be too ambitious with the topics, as there is limited time for coding.

**Bring your OWN ideas for the sprint:**

- That annoying bug you wanted to see fixed
- That missing feature you need
- That documentation page needs some care
- ...
