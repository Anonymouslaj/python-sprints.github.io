The 10th of March, around 500 people in 30 different locations worldwide,
contributed together to improve pandas documentation.

While many great contributions were made, pandas has around 1,200 API pages.
So, there is still some work to do.

In this sprint, each pair of participants (or each participant if you prefer
not to pair-program) will work on making pandas documentation better, or other
fixes.

By the end of the sprint, you should be able to convert a page like this:
- <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.kde.html>

In a page like this:
- <http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.kde.html>

Before the sprint, it's recommended to:

- Bring your own laptop
- Set up your environment
- Join the pandas-sprint channel in PyData London slack
