Pandas is an open source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Its popularity is skyrocketing, and it is becoming the de-facto standard for data science and data engineering. But the number of core developers and contributors did not grow as fast as its popularity, and things like the API documentation would benefit from some help.

This is why we are organizing a worldwide sprint, in which we plan to leave the API documentation for the Series and DataFrame classes in a perfect state.

The sprint will be divided in different chapters. Every chapter has a different website, usually a meetup.com group, where the sprint is coordinated. Find your chapter, and check there the venue, meeting time, etc.

Before the sprint, please make sure:

- Bring your own laptop
- Set up your environment before the sprint
- Make sure you RSVP for your chapter, number of attendees can be limited
- Join the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/py-sprints/pandas-doc) of the sprint
