This is part II of the [Pyntxos sprint](https://python-sprints.github.io/london/2019/08/07/pyntxos.html).

In this sprint we will build a new project, [Pyntxos](https://github.com/python-sprints/pyntxos).

Some context... [EuroSciPy 2019](https://www.euroscipy.org/2019/) will be in September in Bilbao, Spain.
Besides a great [program](https://www.euroscipy.org/2019/program.html) of tutorials, talks,
[maintainers sessions](https://www.euroscipy.org/2019/maintainers.html) and sprints, the conference will
have social activities and networking.

What EuroSciPy will have different from other conferences, is that being in Bilbao, part of the networking
will be done in their traditional [pintxo routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincho). Pintxos are small
portion of food, usually served on top of a small slice of break. There are streets full of pintxo restaurants,
and what is usual is to eat a pintxo in one (with a small glass of wine or beer), socialize standing in the
restaurant or the street for a while, and then go for the next, and keep repeating, following a route.

EuroPython 2015 and 2016 were hosted in Bilbao, and pintxo routes became very popular.
[This article](http://travel.cnn.com/san-sebastians-amazing-street-michelin-experience-736551/)
gives some information about the importance of gastronomy in the Basque country.

It would be easy to just decide the street or area where EuroSciPy participants should go, so
is easy for people to network with other EuroSciPy participants. That would be easy, but not as fun as
overcomplicating things and build a Python project to "optimise" and visualize pintxo routes.

In this sprint we will build a new open source Python project. This will allow participants to learn
how to contribute to open source projects, and the different components of a project:

- API design
- Source code
- Tests
- Documentation
- Linting
- Continuous Integration
- Packaging

And at the same time, we will work and learn some open source libraries for data scraping, analysis,
visualization, and dashboarding. Some of the proposed ones are:

- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/)
- [geoviews](http://geoviews.org/)
- [voila](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila)
- [binder](https://ovh.mybinder.org/)
