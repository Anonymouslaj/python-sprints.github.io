As Pythonistas, we all use [http://www.python.org](www.python.org) at some point. To download Python, for the documentation, the list of events, the jobs board... But no so many of us contribute to it, and as the website is maintained by volunteers, some times it's not up to the standards of our community.

In this sprint we have a mission, make contributions to the Python website easier. And to achieve it, we will work in:
- Updating the website to the latest versions, Python 3.7 (already in beta) and Django 2.0
- Improve its documentation (set up instructions...)
- Make local set up easier (build scripts, make the website sqlite compatible/ready...)

While most of our meetups are beginner frienndly, as we love to mentor people on how to contribute to open source Python projects and to Python itself, in this case we require a decent level of experience in Django. So we can get as much of this important work done.
