I am sure you are excited about the [Open Source Hackathon](https://www.man.com/hackathon2019) on 2nd Nov 2019. To help everyone warm up and ready to go, we have organized a beginner's bootcamp for people who have not contributed to open-source before to come and make your first pull request (PR).

Though this event is designed for beginners who will be attending the hackathon, it is **not limited** to those. Anyone who would like to make the PR for the first time, even not going to the hackathon you are also welcome. For non-beginner hackathon participants, you are also welcome to help mentoring others or social with other participants and talk about what you want to contribute in the hackathon.

This year in October, you only need to make 4 PRs to win the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) challenge (Free T-shirt!), make sure to sign up if you have not done so: [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

As usual, we will give priority to join the sprint to the people who:

- Experienced open source contributors
- People from underrepresented minorities in our sprints

In addition, we will give priority to participants of the [Open Source Hackathon](https://www.man.com/hackathon2019)
