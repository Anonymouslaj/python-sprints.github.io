This sprint will have a new format, in which instead of working on an existing open source project,
we will create a new one from zero. This should make it easier to understand all the different
components of a production ready library. Including:

- API design
- Source code
- Tests
- Documentation
- Linting
- Continuous Integration
- Benchmarks
- Packaging

The goal of the sprint is to build a new **real** open source project that will solve a data science
problem. The problem to solve will be explained during the event.

Agenda
------

- 6pm: Food and networking
- 6:30pm: Sponsor presentation
- 6:35pm: Presentation on programming principles, API design, and the topic of the sprint
- 7pm: Split in groups and start coding
- 9pm: Retrospective presentations

To increase the diversity of our group, **this sprint will be for gender minorities only** (women, non-binary...).
Let us know if you wish to help organise a sprint for a different minority.

The day of the sprint
---------------------
