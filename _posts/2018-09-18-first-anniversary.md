The London Python sprints group started a year ago, and since then we
organised more than 20 sprints. Contributing to projects such as pandas,
dateutil, Tornado, or the python.org website.

To celebrate our first anniversary, we'll have a sprint with the maintainers
of several Python packages. Including [Andreas Mueller](https://amueller.github.io/),
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) core developer, and author of the book
[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do).
Who will visit us from NYC.

Maintainers of other projects include:
- Pablo Galindo, [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Nicholas H. Tollervey, [Mu](https://codewith.mu/)
- Alan Justino da Silva, [Grumpy](https://github.com/google/grumpy)
- Marc Garcia, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

If you maintain or contribute to an open source Python project, and want to mentor people
during the sprint, please let us know (contact the meetup organisers).
