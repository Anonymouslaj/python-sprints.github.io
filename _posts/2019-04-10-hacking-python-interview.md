This event is not stricly speaking a sprint, but to prepare for sprints and Python interviews.

Python interviews often focus in tricky parts of the language, that while not necessarily
complex, are usually known only by experienced programmers. Examples include:

- Generators
- Mutability of objects
- Descriptors
- Namespaces

The idea of this event is to help attendees understand those concepts, in a fun pub quiz format,
with some small programming challenges in it.

By the end of the session, attendees should know the answers to many classic Python questions.
And should have a better knowledge of the language, useful to write better code.

Agenda
------

- 6pm: Food and networking
- 6:30pm: Sponsor presentation
- 6:35pm: Tips and common mistakes in technical tests, by Hamish Pitkeathly
- 7pm: Split in groups
- 7pm-8pm: Pub quiz, part 1
- 8pm-8:20pm: Break
- 8:20pm-9:20pm: Pub quiz, part 2

To increase the diversity of our group, **this sprint will be for gender minorities only** (women, non-binary...).
Let us know if you wish to help organise a sprint for a different minority.

The day of the sprint
---------------------

- Bring your own laptop if you can (come anyway if you can't, we'll work in groups)
- Having Jupyter set up with a recent version of Python is recommended, for the programming exercises
