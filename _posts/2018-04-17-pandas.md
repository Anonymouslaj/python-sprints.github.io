This event will be a mix between a sprint and a workshop. The main goal is
not to contribute to pandas during the sprint, but to better understand
pandas internals, so we can contribute in the future.

What we will do is to work in a project that replicates the same
directory structure of pandas, and we'll add the basic functionality to it:
- Storage of data
- Basic I/O operations
- Indexing
- Basic arithmetic operations

If you know which functionality you want to work on, feel free to try to
understand the pandas code for it.

There will be tasks for all levels, even beginners to Python and pandas.

This is the repository we will work on:
- <https://github.com/datapythonista/minipandas>

You can fork and clone the repository before the sprint, but no need to follow
pandas installation instructions.

Remember to **bring your own laptop**, as usual.

Pizzas and beers will be served during the sprint.
