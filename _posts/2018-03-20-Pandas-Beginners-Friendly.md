After the success of #pandasSprint, with around 500 participants, and almost 200 pull requests sent, we're back to our regular sprints. 
For the ones who missed it, you can get an idea on how it was checking this feed:

For this sprint, beginners will be able to work on small fixes, to learn how to make an open source contribution.
While more experienced participants will be able to choose more challenging tasks.

To get most out of the sprint, it is recommended to try to set up the environment before the meetup.
And remember to being your own computer:

Thanks once again to Harvey Nash and Hamish for hosting our sprint.
And remember that if you need a new job, Hamish is the only recruiter in London who "speaks" Python: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamishpitkeathly/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamishpitkeathly/)
