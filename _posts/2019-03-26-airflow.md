The London Python sprints group started well over a year ago, and since then we organised more than 20 sprints. Contributing to projects such as pandas, dateutil, Tornado, or the python.org website. For this sprint we will look at the [Airflow project](https://airflow.apache.org/) for our experienced sprinters and continue with Marc's successful Data Science from scratch project for the beginners. We would also like to thank [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/uk/) for sponsoring this event, they are joining us as a sponsor for the first time and we are looking forward to working with them.

No matter if this is your first sprint or if you are a seasoned sprinter with us, everyone is welcome. If you have previously contributed to the Airflow project, please contact Florian via DM.

Remember to:

- Bring your own charged laptop
- Check out the [Airflow contributing guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute to Airflow.
