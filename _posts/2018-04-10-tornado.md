In this event, we will have a quick introduction to Tornado (including some
information about concurrency and parallelism), and we will work
on different bugs, including:

- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1122>
- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/729>
- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/2140>
- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1983>
- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1981>
- <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/1595>

Also, we can work on Tornado documentation, updating all the examples
to Python 3, including the use of `async def`.

For first time contributors, we'll have a parallel track. We'll show a
presentation about what's a pull request, and how to send one. And we'll
work on the Python Sprints website, to get some practice in an easier
environment, before you start worrying about the implementation of more
complex projects like Tornado.

Remember to **bring your own laptop**, as usual.

Pizzas and beers will be served during the sprint.
