Let's start contributing in the new year and new decade! We will kick off London Python Sprint with Kedro - A Python library that implements software engineering best-practice for data and ML pipelines. You can have a look at their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) and [documentation page](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/)

We will have the developing team from Quantum Black to lead the sprint. As always, we welcome new contributors. You can have a look at their [issues](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) and see if you can find something you want to work on.

For beginners in open-source, we will have a beginners table for making your first pull request on GitHub.

As usual, we will give priority to join the sprint to the people who:

- Experienced open source contributors
- People from underrepresented minorities in our sprints
