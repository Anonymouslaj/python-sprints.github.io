This will be a follow up of the worldwide #pandasSprint: [https://python-sprints.github.io/pandas/](https://python-sprints.github.io/pandas/)

Beginners to contributing to open source will get a pandas documentation page assigned, and will be guided through the step to make it as good as pandas itself. During the sprint, this step-by-step checklist will help you make your first contribution, and our senior members will help you with any problem.

Advanced contributors will be able to:
- Help reviewing open pull requests
- Experiment with the Sphinx theme of the pandas documentation
- Improve the validation of docstrings
- Refactor the contributing documentation
- And of course mentor more junior contributors

Before the sprint, and to optimise your time, we recommend trying to set up a pandas development environment in your laptop:

For this sprint, we welcome our new sponsor QuantumBlack.
